# Machine Learning A to Z

This project contains activities developed as part of the "Machine Learning A to Z" course. The goal is to implement techniques for **data preprocessing**, **data visualization**, and develop models using **machine learning algorithms**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This repository is designed to walk through the essential stages of machine learning:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Preparing the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

### 2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Applying various techniques to visualize datasets, uncover patterns, and help better understand the data.

### 3. **Model Development**:
   - Implementing and training models with key machine learning algorithms, including:
     - **Supervised Learning**: 
       - Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), etc.
     - **Unsupervised Learning**: 
       - K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, etc.
     - **Reinforcement Learning** and **Deep Learning** (depending on course structure and progress).

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language for implementation.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: Numerical computing.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms and tools.
  - `tensorflow` (if applicable): Deep learning models.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques to handle missing values, duplicate data, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations to explore data distributions and relationships.
- **Model Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Comparison**: Comparing performance across multiple algorithms to select the best one.
